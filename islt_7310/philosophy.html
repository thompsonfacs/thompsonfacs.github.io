      <h4>Where I've been</h4>
        <p class="first-child">As demonstrated through this website, my experiences as an educator have been vast. I have worked in three districts of varying size, taught over ten different courses, and have had experience using a wide range of technology. These experiences have impacted the way I think about education, my values as an educator, and my practices in the classroom. I believe a successful classroom demonstrates active and engaging content, regular technology access, and a welcoming and inclusive environment. </p>
      <h4>What I believe</h4>
        <p class="second-child"> I believe in active learning. I believe all students should be engaged in every class so that they can truly grasp the concepts being taught. Active and engaging classroom instruction is crucial for students to develop the higher order thinking skills needed to be successful in the classroom and in life. When students are given the opportunity to put their learning into practice, they retain the information well beyond the designated school calendar and value their education in a deeper way. </p>
        <p>I believe in learning technology. I believe technology in the classroom can help create an engaging and active learning environment for all students. Even the simplest tasks can be brought to life through computer simulations, interactive notebooks, or online collaboration. Incorporating technology opens a world of possibilities that might not otherwise be available within the four walls of a classroom. Utilizing technology also allows for lesson plans and activities to be more easily adapted to meet all students’ needs, creating a more inclusive environment.</p>
        <p>I believe in education for all. I believe all learners should feel welcome and comfortable in the classroom. They should feel empowered to learn the skills they need to find success in life, whatever that means for them. It is important that an educator not only be welcoming and inclusive, but also equipped with the skills needed to adapt their teaching to their students’ needs. Technology can be a useful tool for quickly adapting and amending lessons and learning activities for a wide spectrum of abilities. </p>
      <h4>Where I'm going</h4>
        <p>My experiences as a student, a teacher, and a building leader have shaped what I believe about education and what a successful classroom looks like. These experiences have also shaped my career aspirations from simply wanting to teach, to desiring to help other educators teach more effectively. I would love to work with educators on a broader scale, in the role of a curriculum director, technology specialist, or instructional coach. I believe in quality education for all and I want to help other educators achieve that in their classrooms. </p>
