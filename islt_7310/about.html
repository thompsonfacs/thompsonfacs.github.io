        <h1>Jamie Thompson</h1>
        <h3>Hello!</h3>
        <p>My name is <strong>Jamie Thompson</strong> and I am a Family and Consumer Sciences teacher. I teach at Battle High School in Columbia, MO. I have been teaching for ten years and look forward to many more.  I love teaching practical skills that help students prepare for life beyond school. My favorite ways to teach are through hands-on learning and technology. <strong>In addition to teaching, I am pursuing a graduate degree in Learning Technologies and Design.</strong><br/><em>In the future, I hope to work as a Curriculum Director or Technology Specialist.</em><strong>I would love to use my passions to help other educators improve their instruction.</strong> </p>
        <p>I earned my Bachelor of Science in Education from Missouri State University in Springfield, MO. I graduated in December 2010 with an emphasis in Family and Consumer Sciences. Currently, I am a graduate student at the University of Missouri in Columbia, MO. I am studying Learning Technologies and Design with an emphasis in Technology in Schools. I hope to complete my degree by May 2023.</p>
