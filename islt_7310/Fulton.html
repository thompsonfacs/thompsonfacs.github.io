        <h1>Family & Consumer Sciences Teacher</h1>
        <h2>Fulton High School, Fulton Public Schools, Fulton, MO</h2>
        <h3>Fall 2013- Spring 2017</h3>
        <p>As a Family and Consumer Sciences teacher at Fulton High School I taught a comprehensive 
            program for 9th-12th grade students. I taught a wide range of courses, including Life 
            Skills, Child Development, Family Living, Foods & Nutrition, Advanced Foods, and Housing 
            & Interior Design. During my time in Fulton, the enrollment in the FACS program increased 
            so dramatically that we were able to hire another full-time teacher and increase course 
            offerings available to students. Advanced Foods was a class created under my leadership 
            that allowed Seniors to take an additional culinary course and advance their skills in the 
            kitchen. 
        </p>
        <p>Midway through my tenure, the high school became a one-to-one technology school and all 
            students were provided with Chromebooks. This opportunity greatly increased my 
            understanding and experience with the Google Education suite. Google Classroom was our 
            primary Learning Management System. In addition to teaching, I also sponsored FCCLA, 
            Hornets Helping Hornets, served as Prom Coordinator, and was a member of the Building 
            Leadership Team.
