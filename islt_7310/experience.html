             <h2>Family & Consumer Sciences Teacher</h2>
             <h3>Holcomb High School, USD 363, Holcomb, KS</h3>
             <h3>Fall 2011- Spring 2013</h3>
             <p>As the sole Family and Consumer Sciences teacher in the district, I taught a comprehensive 
                program for 7th -12th grade students. I taught a wide range of courses, including 
                Exploratory FCS, Consumer Education, Meal Management, Nutrition & Wellness, Human Growth & 
                Development, and Housing Decisions & Design. The high school had a one-to-one technology 
                program, so all my students had access to a school-provided laptop, which allowed me to 
                begin my career with a strong technology emphasis. Edmodo was the primary Learning 
                Management System used. 
             </p>
             <p>In addition to teaching I was also the FCCLA sponsor. During my time in Holcomb we were 
                 able to increase FCCLA membership from 6 to 25 students. In my second year, I also created 
                 a “Sunshine Committee” for the staff to boost morale and increase building engagement.

                <h2>Family & Consumer Sciences Teacher</h2>
                <h3>Fulton High School, Fulton Public Schools, Fulton, MO</h3>
                <h3>Fall 2013- Spring 2017</h3>
                <p>As a Family and Consumer Sciences teacher at Fulton High School I taught a comprehensive 
                    program for 9th-12th grade students. I taught a wide range of courses, including Life 
                    Skills, Child Development, Family Living, Foods & Nutrition, Advanced Foods, and Housing 
                    & Interior Design. During my time in Fulton, the enrollment in the FACS program increased 
                    so dramatically that we were able to hire another full-time teacher and increase course 
                    offerings available to students. Advanced Foods was a class created under my leadership 
                    that allowed Seniors to take an additional culinary course and advance their skills in the 
                    kitchen. 
                </p>
                <p>Midway through my tenure, the high school became a one-to-one technology school and all 
                    students were provided with Chromebooks. This opportunity greatly increased my 
                    understanding and experience with the Google Education suite. Google Classroom was our 
                    primary Learning Management System. In addition to teaching, I also sponsored FCCLA, 
                    Hornets Helping Hornets, served as Prom Coordinator, and was a member of the Building 
                    Leadership Team.

                <h2>Family & Consumer Sciences Teacher</h2>
                <h3>Battle High School, Columbia Public Schools, Columbia, MO</h3>
                <h3>Fall 2017- Present</h3>
                <p>At Battle High School I am one of three Family and Consumer Sciences teachers, so I have 
                    had the opportunity to specialize in teaching the courses that I enjoy most. I currently 
                    teach My Cuisine, Global Cuisine, and Interior Design I & II. Our high school is a 
                    one-to-one technology school, so all of my students have access to a school-provided 
                    laptop, which is frequently used in my classroom. During my time with Columbia Public 
                    Schools my ability to understand and incorporate classroom technology has improved 
                    dramatically. We use Schoology as our primary Learning Management System. I am skilled 
                    and confident in using the tools available through this site and have become a leader in 
                    my department to implement its use. 
                </p>
                <p>In addition to teaching I serve as a Practical Arts representative for the district’s 
                    Standards Referenced Grading initiative and am on the Culturally Responsive Teaching 
                    committee in our building. My love for curriculum and technology has blossomed during my 
                    time here and I have had the opportunity to write and develop several curriculum resources 
                    for the district’s Family and Consumer Sciences department. I have developed an asynchronous 
                    online summer school curriculum for FACS 101, several interactive digital notebooks to be used 
                    in the My Cuisine and Global Cuisine classroom, and various other online resources.
