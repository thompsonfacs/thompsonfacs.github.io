        <h1>Family & Consumer Sciences Teacher</h1>
        <h2>Battle High School, Columbia Public Schools, Columbia, MO</h2>
        <h3>Fall 2017- Present</h3>
        <p>At Battle High School I am one of three Family and Consumer Sciences teachers, so I have 
            had the opportunity to specialize in teaching the courses that I enjoy most. I currently 
            teach My Cuisine, Global Cuisine, and Interior Design I & II. Our high school is a 
            one-to-one technology school, so all of my students have access to a school-provided 
            laptop, which is frequently used in my classroom. During my time with Columbia Public 
            Schools my ability to understand and incorporate classroom technology has improved 
            dramatically. We use Schoology as our primary Learning Management System. I am skilled 
            and confident in using the tools available through this site and have become a leader in 
            my department to implement its use. 
        </p>
        <p>In addition to teaching I serve as a Practical Arts representative for the district’s 
            Standards Referenced Grading initiative and am on the Culturally Responsive Teaching 
            committee in our building. My love for curriculum and technology has blossomed during my 
            time here and I have had the opportunity to write and develop several curriculum resources 
            for the district’s Family and Consumer Sciences department. I have developed an asynchronous 
            online summer school curriculum for FACS 101, several interactive digital notebooks to be used 
            in the My Cuisine and Global Cuisine classroom, and various other online resources. 
        </p>
