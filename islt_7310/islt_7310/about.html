        <h3>Hello!</h3>
        <p>My name is <strong>Jamie Thompson</strong> and I am a Family and Consumer Sciences teacher. I teach at Battle High School in Columbia, MO. I have been teaching for ten years and look forward to many more.  I love teaching practical skills that help students prepare for life beyond school. My favorite ways to teach are through hands-on learning and technology.<br/><strong>In addition to teaching, I am pursuing a graduate degree in Learning Technologies and Design. In the future, I hope to work as a Curriculum Director or Technology Specialist. I would love to use my passions to help other educators improve their instruction.</strong> </p>

Currently, I am a graduate student at the <em>University of Missouri</em> in Columbia, MO. I am studying Learning Technologies and Design with an emphasis in Technology in Schools.
