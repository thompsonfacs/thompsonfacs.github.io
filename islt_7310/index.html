    <h3>Welcome!</h3><p>I am Jamie Thompson; an educator who is passionate about active learning, incorporating technology into my classroom, and creating a welcoming environment for all. Click around to learn more about my background, experience, and goals for the future.</p>  
    <p>This website is designed as a resume webpage, for future use when applying for jobs outside of teaching. Positions I am interested in include Curriculum Director, Technology Specialist, Instructional Coach, and other various contract work. My goal is to showcase my background as an educator. I have included information about the broad range of experience I have had, my areas of success, leadership opportunities, and experience with technology. I hope this website can give additional insight into who I am as an educator and employee, beyond what a typical resume would provide. I want my website to reflect my creativity and innovative approach while also demonstrating my effective and practical nature. I also value good design and friendliness/warmth, so I hope my website conveys those aspects of my personality and professionalism as well.</p>
