    <p><h3>Welcome!</h3>I am Jamie Thompson; an educator who is passionate about active learning, incorporating technology into my classroom, and creating a welcoming environment for all. Click around to learn more about my background, experience, and goals for the future.</p>

    <!--When I validate this page, I get an error that line 21 has an error because there is a "close paragraph" without a "paragraph", but I can't figure out why it isn't recognizing the <p> at the beginning. Any suggestions? Feel free to copy and past the code into a validator to see what I mean.-->
    <!--I'm using the <div> elements because I think I might format these paragraphs differently. Does that seem like a good plan? I think I am understanding the purpose correctly, but feel free to correct me if that seems wrong.-->

    <p>This website is designed as a resume webpage, for future use when applying for jobs outside of teaching. Positions I am interested in include Curriculum Director, Technology Specialist, Instructional Coach, and other various contract work. My goal is to showcase my background as an educator. I have included information about the broad range of experience I have had, my areas of success, leadership opportunities, and experience with technology. I hope this website can give additional insight into who I am as an educator and employee, beyond what a typical resume would provide. I want my website to reflect my creativity and innovative approach while also demonstrating my effective and practical nature. I also value good design and friendliness/warmth, so I hope my website conveys those aspects of my personality and professionalism as well.</p>
