     Hello! My name is Jamie Thompson and I am a Family and Consumer Sciences teacher. I teach at Battle High School in Columbia, MO and just completed my tenth year of teaching. When I was in high school I took a very basic web development class, but that was many moons ago, so this all feels very new to me. I really enjoy design in general and value well-designed products and spaces, so I am excited to broaden my understanding of design and learn how to code. I am also glad that I will be able to get a head start on my Learning Technologies and Design portfolio since this is just my first semester in the program. In my free time I love to read, spend time outside, decorate my home, eat yummy food, and play with my little girl.
